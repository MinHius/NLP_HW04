She participated in several of the fleet 's training cruises and maneuvers , primarily in the North and Baltic Seas . Her peacetime career was relatively uneventful and she suffered no accidents . She was decommissioned for a major reconstruction in 1908 – 10 , after which she was assigned to the Reserve Division with her four sister ships . \\n\n",

They were also deployed briefly to the Baltic but saw no action . In 1915 , the ships were again withdrawn from service and relegated to secondary duties . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was used as a depot ship in Kiel and eventually a torpedo target ship . After the war , the Treaty of Versailles greatly reduced the size of the German Navy . The vessel was sold for scrapping to a German company and broken up in 1920 . \\n\n",

He initiated a program of naval expansion in the late 1880s ; the first battleships built under this program were the four Brandenburg @-@ class ships . These were immediately followed by the five Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleships , of which Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was the third . Her keel was laid on 22 January 1898 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel , as construction number 22 . She was ordered under the contract name Ersatz König Wilhelm , to replace the obsolete armored frigate König Wilhelm . Her scheduled launching on 29 April 1899 was delayed to 1 June after a large fire at the shipyard damaged the slipway . Louise , the Grand Duchess of Baden , christened the ship after her father Wilhelm I of Germany , the ship 's namesake . Wilhelm II gave the launching speech for the ship commemorating his grandfather . After completing fitting @-@ out work , dockyard sea trials began on 19 February 1901 , followed by acceptance trials that started on 18 March . These were completed by May , and she was formally commissioned on 5 May . That year , Erich Raeder — who went on to command the Kriegsmarine in World War II — was promoted to serve as a watch officer aboard her . \\n\n",

After her sister Kaiser Friedrich III ran aground and had to be docked for repairs , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse replaced her as the I Squadron flagship , which was commanded by Prince Heinrich , the brother of Wilhelm II . She held this post until 24 October , when Kaiser Friedrich III returned to service . In the meantime , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was present for the Kiel Week sailing regatta in June and the dedication of a monument at the Marineakademie ( Naval Academy ) in Kiel . At the end of July , she led the squadron on a cruise to Spanish waters , and while docked in Cádiz , they rendezvoused with the Brandenburg @-@ class battleships returning from East Asian waters . The I Squadron was back in Kiel by 11 August , though the late arrival of the Brandenburgs delayed the participation of the I Squadron in the annual autumn fleet training . The maneuvers began with exercises in the German Bight , followed by a mock attack on the fortifications in the lower Elbe . Gunnery drills took place in Kiel Bay before the fleet steamed to Danzig Bay , where the maneuvers concluded on 15 September . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and the rest of I Squadron went on their normal winter cruise to Norway in December , which included a stop at Oslo from 7 to 12 December . \\n\n",

The I Squadron went on a short cruise in the western Baltic then embarked on a major cruise around the British Isles , which lasted from 25 April to 28 May . Individual and squadron maneuvers took place from June to August , interrupted only by a cruise to Norway in July . The annual fleet maneuvers began in August in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade . During the exercises , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was assigned to the \" hostile \" force , as were several of her sister ships . The \" hostile \" force was first tasked with preventing the \" German \" squadron from passing through the Great Belt in the Baltic . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and several other battleships were then tasked with forcing an entry into the mouth of the Elbe River , where the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and Hamburg could be seized . The \" hostile \" flotilla accomplished these tasks within three days . The regular winter cruise followed during 1 – 12 December . \\n\n",

Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse remained in the I Squadron along with her sister ships and the newest Wittelsbach @-@ class battleships , while the older Brandenburg @-@ class ships were placed in reserve to be rebuilt . The first quarter of 1903 followed the usual pattern of training exercises . The squadron went on a training cruise in the Baltic , followed by a voyage to Spain from 7 May to 10 June . In July , the I Squadron went on its annual cruise to Norway . The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea , a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September , and finally a mock attack on Kiel . The exercises concluded on 12 September . The winter cruise began on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and continued into the Skagerrak on 1 December . \\n\n",

      "                             The I Squadron held its first exercise of 1904 in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January . Further squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March . A major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May , and in July the I Squadron and the I Scouting Group visited Britain , stopping at Plymouth on 10 July . The German fleet departed on 13 July , bound for the Netherlands ; the I Squadron anchored in Vlissingen the following day . There , the ships were visited by Queen Wilhelmina . The I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July , when it departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet . The squadron stopped in Molde , Norway , on 29 July , while the other units went to other ports . The fleet reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel , where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August . The fleet then began preparations for the autumn maneuvers , which began on 29 August in the Baltic . The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September , where it took part in a major landing operation , after which the ships took the ground troops from the IX Corps that participated in the exercises to Altona for a parade for Wilhelm II . The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September . Three days later , the fleet returned to the Baltic via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal , where it participated in further landing operations with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps . On 15 September , the maneuvers came to an end . The I Squadron went on its winter training cruise , this time to the eastern Baltic , from 22 November to 2 December . \\n\n",

Individual and squadron training followed , with an emphasis on gunnery drills . On 12 July , the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea . The fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm . The summer cruise ended on 9 August ; the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month . The British fleet stopped in Danzig , Swinemünde , and Flensburg , where it was greeted by units of the German Navy ; Kaiser Wilhelm II and the main German fleet were anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion . The visit 's impact was lessened by the ongoing Anglo @-@ German naval arms race . As a result of the British visit , the 1905 autumn maneuvers were shortened considerably , from 6 to 13 September , and consisted only of exercises in the North Sea . The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight , and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe . During the exercises , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse won the Kaiser 's Schiesspreis ( Shooting Prize ) for excellent gunnery in the I Squadron . In October , the ship was reassigned to the I Division of the II Squadron . In early December , the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise , this time to Danzig , where they arrived on 12 December .

By this time , the newest Deutschland @-@ class battleships were coming into service ; along with the Braunschweig @-@ class battleships , these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons . As a result , the Heimatflotte was renamed the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) . Starting on 13 May , major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the Skagen into the Baltic . The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid @-@ July . The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August . The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland , to join exercises being conducted there . The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August , where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began . On 22 – 24 August , the fleet took part in landing exercises in Eckernförde Bay outside Kiel . The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden , along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel . The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days . \\n\n",

She returned to the fleet for the normal peacetime routine of training exercises , and after the conclusion of the autumn maneuvers , Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse was decommissioned in Kiel on 21 September . She was taken into the Kaiserliche Werft shipyard in Kiel for an extensive modernization that lasted until 1910 . During the refit , four of the ship 's 15 cm guns and the stern @-@ mounted torpedo tube were removed . Two 8 @.@ 8 cm guns were added and the arrangement of the 8 @.@ 8 cm battery was modified . Her superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship 's tendency to roll excessively , and the ship 's funnels were lengthened . After reconstruction , the ship was assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic , along with her sister ships . She was reactivated on 31 July 1911 and assigned to the III Squadron during the annual fleet exercises , then returned on 15 September to the Reserve Division . She remained there for the rest of her peacetime career . \\n\n",

The ships were prepared for war very slowly , and were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August . They were initially tasked with coastal defense , but they served in this capacity for a very short time . In mid @-@ September , the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic , under the command of Prince Heinrich . He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault against the Russians at Windau , but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan . Instead , the V Squadron was to carry the landing force , but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day , disembarked the landing force , and then proceeded to the North Sea , where they resumed guard ship duties . Before the end of the year , the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic . \\n\n",

On 26 December 1914 , the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie . Two days later , the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag , and was back in Kiel by 30 December . The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties , but was withdrawn from front @-@ line service in February 1915 . Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet , coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime , necessitated the deactivation of Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse and her sisters . Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse first went to Hamburg , where her crew was reduced on 5 March . She was moved to Kiel on 30 April , where the rest of her crew were removed . She was disarmed and thereafter used as a depot ship . The following year , the ship was used as a torpedo target ship . In November 1918 , Germany surrendered and signed the Armistice at Compiègne that ended the fighting . According to Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles , signed on 28 June 1919 , that formally ended the war , Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the \" Deutschland or Lothringen types \" .

Leibovitz promised Lennon that a photo with Ono would make the front cover of the magazine , even though she initially tried to get a picture with Lennon by himself . Leibovitz said , \" Nobody wanted [ Ono ] on the cover \" .

Among them was Mark David Chapman . It was common for fans to wait outside the Dakota to meet Lennon and ask for his autograph . Chapman , a 25 @-@ year @-@ old security guard from Honolulu , Hawaii , had previously travelled to New York to murder Lennon in October ( before the release of Double Fantasy ) , but had changed his mind and returned home . Chapman silently handed Lennon a copy of Double Fantasy , and Lennon obliged with an autograph . After signing the album , Lennon asked , \" Is this all you want ? \" Chapman smiled and nodded in agreement . Photographer and Lennon fan Paul Goresh took a photo of the encounter . Chapman had been waiting for Lennon outside the Dakota since mid @-@ morning , and had even approached the Lennons ' five @-@ year @-@ old son , Sean , who was with the family nanny , Helen Seaman , when they returned home in the afternoon . According to Chapman , he briefly touched the boy 's hand . \\n\n",

Lennon had decided against dining out so he could be home in time to say goodnight to his son , before going on to the Stage Deli restaurant with Ono . Lennon liked to oblige any fans who had been waiting for long periods of time to meet him with autographs or pictures , once saying during an interview with BBC Radio 's Andy Peebles on 6 December 1980 : \" People come and ask for autographs , or say ' Hi ' , but they don 't bug you . \" The Lennons exited their limousine on 72nd Street instead of driving into the more secure courtyard of the Dakota . \\n\n",

As Lennon passed by , he glanced briefly at Chapman , appearing to recognize him from earlier . Seconds later , Chapman took aim directly at the center of Lennon 's back and fired five hollow @-@ point bullets at him from a Charter Arms .38 Special revolver in rapid succession from a range of about nine or ten feet ( about 3 m ) away . Based on statements made that night by NYPD Chief of Detectives James Sullivan , numerous radio , television , and newspaper reports claimed at the time that , before firing , Chapman called out \" Mr. Lennon \" and dropped into a combat stance . Later court hearings and witness interviews did not include either \" Mr. Lennon \" or the \" combat stance \" description . Chapman has said he does not remember calling out to Lennon before he fired , but he claimed to have taken a \" combat stance \" in a 1992 interview with Barbara Walters . The first bullet missed , passing over Lennon 's head and hitting a window of the Dakota building . Two of the next bullets struck Lennon in the left side of his back , and two more penetrated his left shoulder . \\n\n",

He then fell to the floor , scattering cassettes that he had been carrying . The concierge , Jay Hastings , first started to make a tourniquet , but upon ripping open Lennon 's blood @-@ stained shirt and realizing the severity of his multiple injuries , he covered Lennon 's chest with his uniform jacket , removed his blood @-@ covered glasses , and summoned the police . \\n\n",

Perdomo shouted at Chapman , \" Do you know what you 've just done ? \" to which Chapman calmly replied , \" Yes , I just shot John Lennon . \" The first policemen to arrive were Steven Spiro and Peter Cullen , who were at 72nd Street and Broadway when they heard a report of shots fired at the Dakota . The officers arrived around two minutes later and found Chapman sitting \" very calmly \" on the sidewalk .

They immediately put Chapman in handcuffs and placed him in the back seat of their squad car . Chapman made no attempt to flee or resist arrest . \\n\n",

They found Lennon lying face down on the floor of the reception area with Hastings attending to him , blood pouring from his mouth and his clothing already soaked with blood . Realizing the extent of his injuries , the policemen decided not to wait for an ambulance and immediately carried Lennon into their squad car and rushed him to St Luke 's @-@ Roosevelt Hospital Center . Officer James Moran said they placed Lennon in the back seat . Reportedly , Moran asked , \" Are you John Lennon ? \" to which Lennon nodded and replied \" Yes . \" There are conflicting accounts of this , however . According to another account by officer Bill Gamble , Lennon nodded slightly and tried to speak , but could only manage to make a gurgling sound , and lost consciousness shortly thereafter . \\n\n",
      " Dr. Stephan Lynn , head of the Emergency Department , who had been called in again after having just returned home after a 13 @-@ hour @-@ long work shift , received Lennon in the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital a few minutes before 11 : 00 pm when Officers Frauenberger and Moran arrived , with Moran carrying Lennon on his back from their squad car and onto a gurney , into the emergency room demanding a doctor for a multiple gunshot wound victim . When Lennon arrived , he had no pulse and was not breathing . Dr. Lynn , two other doctors , a nurse and two or three other medical attendants worked on Lennon for ten to 15 minutes in a desperate attempt to resuscitate him . As a last resort , Dr. Lynn cut open Lennon 's chest and attempted manual heart massage to restore circulation , but he quickly discovered that the damage to the blood vessels above and around Lennon 's heart from the multiple bullet wounds was too great . Lennon was pronounced dead on arrival in the emergency room at the Roosevelt Hospital at 11 : 15 pm by Dr. Lynn , but the time of 11 : 07 pm has also been reported . Lennon 's body was then taken to the city morgue at 520 First Avenue and autopsied . The cause of death was reported as \" hypovolemic shock , caused by the loss of more than 80 % of blood volume due to multiple through @-@ and @-@ through gunshot wounds to the chest and aortic arch \" . The pathologist who performed the autopsy on Lennon also stated in his report that even with prompt medical treatment , no person could have lived for more than a few minutes with such multiple bullet injuries to all of the major arteries and veins around the heart . \\n\n",

As Lennon had been shot four times at close range with hollow @-@ point bullets , Lennon 's affected organs ( particularly his left lung ) and major blood vessels above his heart were virtually destroyed upon impact .

Weiss from WABC @-@ TV had been waiting to be treated in the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital due to having been involved in an accident earlier that evening while riding his motorcycle . Weiss recalled in an interview for the CNN series Crimes of the Century in 2013 that he had seen Lennon being wheeled into the room surrounded by several police officers . After he learned what happened , Weiss called back to the station to relay the information . Eventually , word made its way through the chain of command to ABC News president Roone Arledge , who was tasked with finding a way to bring this major development to the viewing audience . \\n\n",

Cosell , who had previously interviewed Lennon on a 1974 broadcast , was chosen to do so but was apprehensive of it at first , as he felt the game should take precedence and that it was not their place to break such a big story .
